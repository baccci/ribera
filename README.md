# Ribera's Website

This app was created as a part of a university project and is based on a local restaurant in my city. It is not an official representation and is intended solely for educational purposes. No transactions can be made, and no data is sent or stored.

The website's design is inspired by the restaurant's aesthetic, with all graphics, except for the logo, created by me. This includes icons for filters, header underlines, cart icons, footer backgrounds, and more.

I rewrote the entire app from scratch, migrating from pages router to app router, utilizing the new RSC, and adhering to a new file convention. I made an effort to use URL state whenever possible.

### Planned Features:

- [x] Payment modal
- [x] Ticket download
- [ ] Full landing page
- [ ] Missing sections
- [ ] Login system
- [ ] Migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

In order to run it in development server you must install the dependencies with

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

and the run it

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
